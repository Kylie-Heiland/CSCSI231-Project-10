# CSCSI231-Project-10
This program begins by having a user entering a sentence. After inputting the sentence, the program outputs the length of the sentence EXCLUDING the period at the end (as it is merely used for loop purposes). Then, the user is instructed to enter a valid index (between 0 - length-1), and the character is outputted. After doing so, the user inputs another sentence and it is compared with the original sentence. If the sentences have the same case, punctuation, etc., equal is outputted, else it outputs as unequal. Using the first sentence again, the user is asked to enter two valid indexes and a substring (aka characters are outputted all on the same line) is outputted. Finally the user inputs an integer and it is converted into MyString and outputted.
